# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Kafka Cluster Node Self-Healing Automation system. The system will provide continuous monitoring of Apache Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes, automatically attempt recovery procedures when failures are detected, and escalate to human operators when automated recovery fails. The goal is to achieve 95%+ reduction in manual intervention for recoverable node failures while maintaining comprehensive audit trails and notification capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want the system to continuously monitor all Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes, so that I can detect failures immediately without manual monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the monitoring service starts THEN it SHALL poll all configured Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes at configurable intervals (default 30 seconds)
2. WHEN a health check is performed THEN the system SHALL verify node responsiveness via multiple methods (REST API, JMX, CLI, or socket connections)
3. WHEN a node becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL detect the failure within one monitoring cycle
4. WHEN monitoring multiple nodes THEN the system SHALL perform health checks concurrently to minimize total check time

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want the system to automatically attempt recovery procedures when node failures are detected, so that service disruptions are minimized without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node failure is detected THEN the system SHALL immediately initiate the first recovery attempt
2. WHEN executing recovery actions THEN the system SHALL support multiple recovery methods (service restart, shell scripts, Ansible playbooks, Salt commands)
3. WHEN a recovery attempt fails THEN the system SHALL wait a configurable interval before the next attempt
4. WHEN the maximum retry count is reached THEN the system SHALL stop recovery attempts and escalate to notification
5. WHEN a node recovers successfully THEN the system SHALL log the successful recovery and resume normal monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want to receive detailed notifications when automated recovery fails, so that I can take manual action with full context of what was attempted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated recovery fails after all retry attempts THEN the system SHALL send an email notification to configured recipients
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the email SHALL include node details, failure timestamps, all recovery actions attempted, and relevant log excerpts
3. WHEN SMTP is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log notification failures and attempt to resend notifications when connectivity is restored
4. WHEN a previously failed node recovers THEN the system SHALL send a recovery confirmation notification

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want comprehensive logging and audit trails of all system actions, so that I can analyze patterns, troubleshoot issues, and meet compliance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any monitoring action occurs THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp, node identifier, and result
2. WHEN recovery actions are executed THEN the system SHALL log the command executed, exit code, stdout, and stderr
3. WHEN notifications are sent THEN the system SHALL log the recipient, timestamp, and delivery status
4. WHEN log files reach a configurable size THEN the system SHALL rotate logs automatically while preserving historical data
5. WHEN the system starts or stops THEN it SHALL log startup/shutdown events with configuration summary

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want flexible configuration options for cluster topology, retry policies, and notification settings, so that I can adapt the system to different environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configuration from YAML, JSON, or INI files
2. WHEN configuration includes cluster topology THEN the system SHALL support multiple Kafka brokers and Zookeeper nodes with individual settings
3. WHEN configuration includes retry policies THEN the system SHALL allow per-node-type retry counts and wait intervals
4. WHEN configuration includes notification settings THEN the system SHALL support SMTP configuration with authentication and multiple recipients
5. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail to start with clear error messages indicating the configuration issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want the system to be extensible and modular, so that I can add new monitoring methods, recovery actions, and notification channels without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new monitoring methods THEN the system SHALL support pluggable monitoring modules through a defined interface
2. WHEN adding new recovery actions THEN the system SHALL support pluggable recovery modules through a defined interface
3. WHEN adding new notification channels THEN the system SHALL support pluggable notification modules through a defined interface
4. WHEN loading plugins THEN the system SHALL validate plugin compatibility and log any loading failures
5. WHEN plugins fail during execution THEN the system SHALL continue operating with remaining functional plugins

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want the system to handle security credentials safely, so that cluster access and notification systems remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL support environment variables, encrypted configuration files, or external credential stores
2. WHEN logging activities THEN the system SHALL never log passwords, API keys, or other sensitive credentials
3. WHEN connecting to Kafka or Zookeeper THEN the system SHALL support SSL/TLS and SASL authentication methods
4. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL support secure SMTP connections (TLS/SSL)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a Kafka operations engineer, I want the system to be resilient and continue operating even when individual components fail, so that monitoring coverage is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monitoring check fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL continue monitoring other nodes
2. WHEN a recovery action fails to execute THEN the system SHALL log the failure and continue with remaining recovery attempts
3. WHEN notification delivery fails THEN the system SHALL queue notifications for retry without stopping monitoring
4. WHEN the system encounters unexpected errors THEN it SHALL log the error and continue operating rather than crashing
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical monitoring over less important operations
